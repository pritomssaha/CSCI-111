/* Write a complete C++ program that asks the user to type a big integer n. It should then ask 5 times for the user to type a bigger value
of n and then thank the user. However, if the user ever enters a value that is not bigger it should immediately exit with no message.
Partial credit will be given for programs that perform some of the required steps but excessively long or complicated programs will lose
credit. */
